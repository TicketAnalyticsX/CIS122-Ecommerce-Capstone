# Ecommerce Insights and Optimization

This project is a capstone for CIS 122, focusing on analyzing ecommerce data to generate actionable insights and recommendations. The project involves working with data on product categories, shipping costs, and seasonal sales trends to optimize business operations and improve profitability.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze ecommerce data and provide insights into:

1.  **Top-performing product categories** that bring the most revenue.
2.  **Shipping cost analysis**, especially for heavier or larger products.
3.  **Seasonal sales trends**, identifying peak months and planning inventory accordingly.

### Key Features

-   Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL and Python.
-   Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in sales and shipping.
-   Recommendations to improve shipping efficiency, boost product promotions, and align inventory with seasonal demand.

## Technologies Used

-   **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the data.
-   **Python**: For data visualization and additional analysis.
-   **Google BigQuery**: To store and process the dataset.
-   **dbdiagram.io**: For visualizing database schemas.
-   **Excel**: For data aggregation and initial exploration.

## Project Files

-   **ERD Diagram.png**: Entity Relationship Diagram for database schema.
-   **SQL Queries**: Scripts to extract and analyze data.
-   **Insights and Recommendations.pdf**: Document summarizing the insights and actionable recommendations.
-   **order-items.csv**: Dataset containing order-level data.
-   **products.csv**: Dataset with product information.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    bash
